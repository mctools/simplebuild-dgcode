Particle generators
*******************

As important for a Geant4 simulation as the geometry, materials, and physics
list, is the initial set of particles to be "let loose" in the simulation each
event. These source particles are called *primary* particles in Geant4
terminology, and any particle generated indirectly as a result of the simulation
of the interactions between particles and the material of the simulation
geometry are accordingly denoted *secondary* particles.

Whenever creating a new primary particle, a generator module must fully define
its initial state, which typically means choosing:

* Particle type (neutron, gamma, e-, ...)
* Kinetic energy (or wavelength)
* Position (must be within the *world volume* of the simulation geometry)
* Direction

Other parameters which can be set, but often are not, are:

* Weight (normally only different from 1 when some clever setup involving event
  biasing is contemplated)
* Polarisation (when not mentioned, it normally means that the particle is
  generated unpolarised)
* Time (when not mentioned, it normally means that the particle is generated at
  :math:`t=0`)

In dgcode, generators are implemented as separate specialised modules with
configurable parameters in the same manner as geometry modules are. The main
differences are firstly that generator modules are very often reusable across
many specific projects or studies, while this is more rarely seen for geometry
modules. Secondly, as we shall see below, generator modules can be implemented
purely in just a few lines of Python code if desired.

Configuration
-------------

Picking a generator module in a :ref:`sim-script <sbsimscript>` is done in the
same manner as picking a geometry module: one imports the desired generator
module, instantiates a given generator instance (called ``gen`` below), and
optionally changes the default value of one or more of the parameters available
for the given generator module. Of course, those values can again be overwritten
from the command line should the user of the simulation script so desire. In
the example below, the author of the simulation script in question has decided
to use the :sbpkg:`SimpleGen <G4StdGenerators/libsrc/SimpleGen.cc>` generator
module from the :sbpkg:`G4StdGenerators` package:

.. code-block:: python

  #!/usr/bin/env python

  import G4GeoTriCorder.GeoTriCorder as geomodule
  geo = geomodule.create()

  import G4StdGenerators.SimpleGen as genmodule
  gen = genmodule.create()
  gen.particleName = 'neutron'
  gen.neutron_wavelength_aangstrom = 2.2

  import G4Launcher
  launcher = G4Launcher(geo,gen)
  launcher.go()

If the above script is located in a folder ``TriCorder/scripts/sim`` (i.e. in
the ``scripts/`` sub-dir of a package called ``TriCorder``), it will end up as a
command ``sb_tricorder_sim`` (avid readers of the present wiki might recognise
the TriCorder example from the instructions for :ref:`creating a new simulation
project <sbnewsimproject>`). One can see the available parameters by running the
command with ``-p`` (if you forget that the flag is ``-p`` you can always run
with ``-h`` first for usage instructions):

.. include:: ../build/autogen_tricorder_sim_p.txt
  :literal:

To understand what the different parameters are for, there are several strategies:

* Read on further down this page where all the generators from the
  :sbpkg:`G4StdGenerators` package are mentioned.
* Guess based on the hopefully very descriptive names of the parameters.
* Supply the ``--dataviewer`` or ``--aimdataviewer`` flag to generate and visualise few
  or many events in a 3D viewer, and see how the tracks are generated in the
  geometry (read more :ref:`here <sbaimdataviewer>`):

   .. image:: images/coolnamehere_aim2.png
      :height: 200px
      :align: center
* Supply the ``--verbose`` flag to generate a few events and print out some info
  about them.
* Locate the source code of the generator module in question and try to
  understand what it does, or ask its author.

Investigate generator without geometry
--------------------------------------

If you are not working with a particular geometry, and want to investigate a
given generator module, it is possible to do so even without a :ref:`sim-script
<sbsimscript>`, by using the ``sb_g4utils_querygenerator`` command (in the same
way that the ``sb_g4utils_geodisplay`` can be used to visualise a geometry
module without a generator). Get full usage instructions by::

  $> sb_g4utils_querygenerator -h

Note in particular that by adding the ``-v`` and ``-n<NEVTS>`` flags, one can
launch the visualisation to see some events generated with it in a empty
geometry.

Standard generators
-------------------

Three standard generators are provided in the :sbpkg:`G4StdGenerators`
package.

* ``SimpleGen``: A very simple generator, producing 1 primary particle each
  event, allowing the user to modify position, direction and energy (or, for
  neutrons, wavelength -- but not both wavelength and energy at the same time):

  .. include:: ../build/autogen_querygenerator_simplegen.txt
    :literal:

* ``FlexGen``: The big-brother of ``SimpleGen`` which provides more parameters
  and features. Note that this is a strict super-set of the ``SimpleGen``
  parameters, so migrating code from ``SimpleGen`` to ``FlexGen`` should be as
  simple as renaming ``G4StdGenerators.SimpleGen`` to
  ``G4StdGenerators.FlexGen`` in the import statement. The additional features
  ``FlexGen`` provides over ``SimpleGen`` are:

    * Ability to generate particle directions in spherical coordinates.
    * Ability to randomize all variables uniformly over an interval. As an
      example, suppose one would like the y-coordinate of the particles' initial
      position to be distributed uniformly between 0.5m and 1.0m, then rather
      than setting the ``fixed_y_meters`` variable, one would set::

        randomize_y=True random_min_y_meters=0.5 random_max_y_meters=1.0
    * And finally the ability to specify particle identity via `pdg code
      <https://pdg.lbl.gov/2023/reviews/rpp2023-rev-monte-carlo-numbering.pdf>`__
      rather than names, and to generate more than 1 primary particle each
      event.
    * Too see all the parameters of ``FlexGen``, simply run the command::

        $> sb_g4utils_querygenerator -g G4StdGenerators.FlexGen
* ``ProfiledBeamGen``: A generator which generates a beam of particles starting
  at z=0 and having a given profile in the x-y plane, symmetric around
  :math:`(x,y)=(0,0)`, unless an offset is given:

  .. include:: ../build/autogen_querygenerator_profiledbeamgen.txt
    :literal:

  * It shares the options for setting particle type and number with FlexGen, but
    for energy, it provides options for either a Gaussian spread in neutron
    wavelength, or a perfect thermal distribution.

* The beam profile is determined by the ``spread_...`` parameters, with
  ``spread_x_mm`` and ``spread_y_mm`` (giving the dimensions), and
  ``spread_mode`` giving the type of spread: either ``GAUSSIAN``,
  ``FLATCIRCULAR`` or ``FLATRECTANGULAR``. The ``GAUSSIAN`` mode obviously gives
  Gaussian distributions with widths of ``spread_x_mm`` and ``spread_y_mm``
  respectively, while the other two gives uniform rectangular or ellipsoidal
  distributions, within an extent also determined by ``spread_x_mm`` and
  ``spread_y_mm``.

.. admonition:: Default generator orientation
  :class: tip

  Note that by convention we try to default all generators to shoot particles in
  the direction of positive :math:`z`, starting at :math:`z=0` and "near"
  :math:`(x,y)=(0,0)`. That way, users will be more easily able to switch
  generators without completely having to re-orient their geometry, rewrite
  their analyses, etc. Of course, this is not a strict rule, and sometimes a
  different setup makes sense.


Generating from MCPL files
--------------------------

The :sbpkg:`G4MCPLPlugins.MCPLGen<G4MCPLPlugins/pycpp_MCPLGen/mod.cc>` module
allows one to easily inject particles from MCPL files into a Geant4
simulation. The particles in those files can come from a multitude of sources,
such as MCNP simulations, McStas simulations, or even other Geant4
simulations. Please find more information for how to create, inspect or modify
MCPL files :ref:`here <sbmcpl>`, on the `the official MCPL page at GitHub
<https://mctools.github.io/mcpl/>`__, or in the `published MCPL paper
<https://doi.org/10.1016/j.cpc.2017.04.012>`__. To use the MCPL generator,
simply import and use the
:sbpkg:`G4MCPLPlugins.MCPLGen<G4MCPLPlugins/pycpp_MCPLGen/mod.cc>` module in
your :ref:`sim-script <sbsimscript>`, setting at least the ``input_file``
parameter:

.. code-block:: python

  import G4MCPLPlugins.MCPLGen as Gen
  gen = Gen.create()
  gen.input_file = "mydata.mcpl.gz"

Other optional parameters can be used to translate/rotate the coordinate and
directions found in the MCPL file before injecting the particles into your
Geant4 coordinate system:

.. code-block:: python

  gen.dx_meter = 0.1    #translate x coordinates by 10cm
  gen.dy_meter = -0.1   #translate y coordinates by -10cm
  gen.dz_meter = 10     #translate z coordinates by 10m
  gen.rotx_degree = 90  #rotate particle directions 90 degrees around the x axis
  gen.roty_degree = -10 #rotate particle directions -10 degrees around the y axis
  gen.rotz_degree = 180 #rotate particle directions 180 degrees around the x axis

Finally, the ``input_filter`` parameter can be used to select just some of the
particles in the file, by providing a logical expression like in the following
examples (more info about how to construct such filter expressions can be found
:ref:`here <sbmcplfilterexpressions>`):

.. code-block:: python

  # High energy photons only:
  gen.input_filter = "ekin > 2.0MeV && pdgcode == 22"

  #low energy neutrons only:
  gen.input_filter = "is_neutron && neutron_wl > 0.5Aa"

  #only neutrons or high energy photons:
  gen.input_filter = "is_neutron || (is_photon && ekin > 1MeV)"

Custom generators defined in Python
-----------------------------------

Wouldn't it be nice if instead of relying on generators written by other people,
you could add a few lines of code in your :ref:`sim-script <sbsimscript>` to put
exactly the particles you want exactly where you want them? It is, fortunately,
straight-forward to do exactly that by implementing your own generator:

.. code-block:: python

  #!/usr/bin/env python

  import G4CustomPyGen
  import Core.Units as Units

  class MyPyGen(G4CustomPyGen.GenBase):

  def declare_parameters(self):
      self.addParameterDouble("energy_MeV",1.0)
      self.addParameterDouble("extent_mm",2.0)
      self.addParameterString("particle_name","neutron")

  def init_generator(self,gun):
      gun.set_type(self.particle_name)
      gun.set_direction(0,0,1)

  def generate_event(self,gun):
      gun.set_energy(max(0,self.randGauss(1*Units.eV,self.energy_MeV*Units.MeV)))
      y=self.rand(-1.0,1.0)*self.extent_mm*Units.mm
      gun.set_position( 0, y, 0)

  gen = MyPyGen()

  import G4StdGeometries.GeoSlab as geomodule
  geo = geomodule.create()

  import G4Launcher
  launcher = G4Launcher(geo,gen)
  launcher.go()

Note in the example above how a generator implemented in this manner even can
have free parameters (e.g. ``energy_MeV``). Additionally, note that one can of
course choose to put the implementation of the generator class inside an actual
Python module, so it can easily be used in several different simulation
scripts. You can find several examples of that in the
:sbpkg:`G4CustomPyGen.Examples<G4CustomPyGen/python/Examples.py>` module.

Histogram-based generators
--------------------------

If you have a 1-dimensional `SimpleHists <SimpleHists.html>`__ histogram with a
distribution of some quantity, you can sample it during particle generation and
use the sampled value as desired: perhaps for the energy spectrum, or the
initial position of your generated particles if you have a histogram with a
realistic beam profile. So if for instance you have the following histogram
stored in a file ``example.shist`` with the key ``alpha_energy``, representing a
distribution of energies in keV of alpha particles:

|image_alphaenergydisthist|

Assuming for simplicity you are happy with all particles starting at
:math:`(0,0,0)` and headed along the positive :math:`z`-axis, you can use then
use the histogram to implement the following generator:

.. code-block:: python


  class AlphaHistGen(G4CustomPyGen.GenBase):

    def declare_parameters(self):
        self.addParameterString('energy_histogram',
                                'G4CustomPyGen/example.shist:alpha_energy:keV')

    def init_generator(self,gun):
        gun.set_type('alpha')
        gun.set_direction(0,0,1)
        gun.set_position(0,0,0)
        self._esampler = self.create_hist_sampler(self.energy_histogram)

    def generate_event(self,gun):
        gun.set_energy(self._esampler())

Note how we specify the input histogram in one single string with syntax
``<filename>:<histogramkey>:<unit>``, and expose the string as a user-visible
parameter called ``energy_histogram``, allowing users to easily switch histogram
if desired. Here, ``<filename>`` can be either the path to the :ref:`histogram
<sbsimplehists>` file, or in the form ``<pkg>/<file>``, if the histogram file is
stored in the ``data/`` directory of some simplebuild package. The
``<histogramkey>`` is used to select which histogram from the file to use, and
the optional ``<unit>`` part can be specified either as a name or a number. The
string is then passed to ``self.create_hist_sampler(..)`` during initialisation
and the returned sampler is stored as ``self._esampler``, which can be invoked
during ``generate_event()`` calls by calling ``self._esampler()``, returning one
value sampled at random from the histogram.

Note that in addition to the actual bin-contents of the histogram, the sampler
also considers the min/max statistics as well as any underflow/overflow content.

Generating from Griff files
---------------------------

It is possible to use :ref:`Griff <sbgriff>` files as a source of particles, by
using the :sbpkg:`G4GriffGen.GriffGen<G4GriffGen/pycpp_GriffGen/mod.cc>`
generator module:

.. code-block:: python

  import G4GriffGen.GriffGen as Gen
  gen = Gen.create()
  gen.input_file = 'mygrifffile.griff'
  gen.primary_only = True

If ``primary_only`` is set to ``True``, Geant4 particles will be generated based
on the pre-step info of the first step of all primary particles found in the
file (thus, it can be used to "re-shoot" the generated events inside a Griff
file). If ``primary_only`` is set to ``False``, Geant4 particles will be
generated based on the pre-step info of the first step of *all* particles in the
file -- which is obviously mostly useful when the Griff file was created with a
certain filter to select the particles going into the file (e.g. a volume filter
capturing all particles as they enter a particular volume).
