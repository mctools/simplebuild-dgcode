SimpleHists
===========

This page concerns our custom histogram solution for C++ and Python code,
implemented as the simplebuild package ``SimpleHists``.

Motivation
----------

In addition to the obvious use cases of histograms (e.g. estimations of data
probability density functions), histogram data types are also highly useful
tools for data reduction, as they have a limited size in memory and on disk, no
matter how much data is filled in them. Implemented correctly, they can even
provide more functionality than just the counting of data-points in a certain
binning. Examples include handling of errors, weights, and
normalisations; collection of one-pass statistics such as unbinned mean and
variance; association of metadata (title, axis labels); and utilities for
on-disk storage and quick plotting.

Histogram classes are for instance found in the `ROOT <http://root.cern/>`__
framework which is commonly used in high energy physics, but for Python-centric
analyses based on e.g. "PyLab" (taken here to mean Numpy+SciPy+Matplotlib),
having a dependency on ROOT can be a bit honerous. However, one runs into the
problem that PyLab does not by default include histogram classes. Rather, very
basic histogramming functionality exists, but requires one to first collect all
data into arrays, thus defeating the primary data reduction purpose of such
histogram classes.

Features
--------

The light-weight histogram classes, "SimpleHists", provided in dgcode have
several features that are all important to their usage in dgcode-based projects:
usage from both C++ and Python, integration with PyLab, persistification, quick
plotting, extraction to Numpy arrays. Finally, the histograms have the crucial
ability that data files collected in multiple concurrent jobs can be safely
merged without the loss of any statistical metadata. More specifically, the
list of features include:

* Three feature-rich types of histograms: 1D, 2D and counter collection.
* HistCollection which is an object representing a collection of histograms,
  each identified by a unique key.

    * Such a collection class simplifies user code.
    * Can be easily merged with other collections.
    * Can be easily written to, or loaded from, a file (extension ``.shist``).
* Histograms themselves are also easily (de) serialisable:

    * To/from raw bytes in both C++ and Python (in the form of ``std::string`` or
      ``bytes`` respectively).
    * They work with the standard Python ``pickle`` module.
* Histograms can be cloned, merged, normalised, scaled, integrated, ...
* The C++ interface is simple to use and very fast.
* The Python interface additionally features integration with Numpy arrays and
  Matplotlib plotting.
* Several command-line scripts for working with ``.shist`` files are available,
  supply ``--help`` to any of them for more detailed instructions:

    * ``sb_simplehists_browse``: Open up graphical browser.
    * ``sb_simplehists_merge``: Merge contents in two ``.shist`` files into
      one. This is meant as an easy and reliable way to merge output done in
      concurrent computing situations (such as at a computing cluster).
    * ``sb_simplehists_extract``: Extract a subset of histograms from a file into
      a smaller one.
    * ``sb_simplehists2root_convertfile``: For compatibility, convert histograms
      in a ``.shist`` file to `ROOT <http://root.cern.ch/>`__ histograms and store
      them in a ``.root`` file. This requires ROOT to have been installed in the
      environment, which `might not be simple
      <https://github.com/conda-forge/root-feedstock/issues/214>`__.

Example: Producing histograms in C++
-------------------------------------

Imagine for instance the following to be part of some big event loop running on
a cluster, collecting histograms in a large number of jobs:

.. code-block:: c++

  SimpleHists::HistCollection hc;
  auto h_edep = hc.book1D("Energy deposited in counting gas",100,0.0,2000,"edep");
  h_edep->setXLabel("keV");
  auto h_scatterpos = hc.book2D("Scatter coordinates",100,0.0,2.0,100,0.0,2.0,"scatterpos");
  h_scatterpos->setXLabel("depth [meters]");
  h_scatterpos->setXLabel("height [meters]");
  //Some big loop:
  for (unsigned ievt=0; ievt < bignum; ++ievt) {
    // ...
    // All sorts of expensive stuff, for instance related to Geant4 simulations.
    // ...
    h_edep->fill(edep);
    h_scatterpos->fill(particle.x(),particle.y());
    // ...
  }
  hc.saveToFile("results.shist");

Afterwards, one can then use the ``sb_simplehists_merge`` command to merge the
``result.shist`` files from many different cluster jobs into one. Thus, relevant
data from many billions and billions of events are now all present in a single
small (tens of kilobytes) file which can be copied easily down to ones laptop
for subsequent analysis. Of course, before launching computationally intensive
jobs on a cluster, you will most likely have been running the same code on your
own machine, while developing and verifying it.

Example: Python analysis of histograms
---------------------------------------

After having copied down the ``results.shist`` file to your laptop, the first
thing to do is to have a quick look inside. This is done by the command::

  $> sb_simplehists_browse results.shist

This opens up a graphical browser which can be used to quickly view the
histograms with various options for the presentations. At this stage it is
already possible to produce a few quick plots for a paper, talk or email.

For more advanced analysis, one can use Python and the plethora of utilities
available there (e.g. all the utilities available in Matplotlib and SciPy). Here
is a small example of how one can get data out in formats ready to input to the
various PyLab plotting routines:

.. code-block:: python

  import pylab as pl
  import SimpleHists as sh
  hc = sh.HistCollection('results.shist')
  h_edep = hc.hist('edep')
  #One can launch the quick interactive view for this histogram by:
  h_edep.plot()
  #But for advanced pylab analysis and plots you can ask for the contents
  #and bin edges in the same format as pl.histogram(..) would return:
  contents, edges = h_edep.histogram()
  #This can be used for custom analysis (using scipy fitting/interpolation
  #tools, making plots with analytical results on top, etc., etc.)
  #One can access other statistics as well of course:
  print('edep variance =', h_edep.rms)
  print('mean edep     =', h_edep.mean)
