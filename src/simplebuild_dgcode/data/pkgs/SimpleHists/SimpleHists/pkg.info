######################################################################


Package containing a few very simple histogramming classes which can be filled
on the fly and later on serialised, printed or converted to numpy arrays.

On purpose we do NOT include an error array like in ROOT in 2D hists. One can
merge(=add) and scale histograms with positive factors. One can NOT subtract
histograms or scale with negative factors. The only annotations allowed are
title, xlabel and ylabel, and while plot methods exists on the python side,
using them will never change the histogram state itself.

FIXME: Double check on a low-bin histogram that getPercentileBin works correctly, also when under/overflow plays a role.

TODO: units support? I.e. scale all vals with 1/unitx and all weights with 1/unity
TODO: add test for getBinSum
TODO: median on 2d hists.
TODO: Fix HistCounts plotting when no counters are added.
TODO: name: MOPHI (Merge-able One-Pass HIstograms)?
todo: custom exception rather than std::runtime_error?
TODO: access counters as properties
TODO: access hists as properties so tab completion would work in ipython? Would not work for all keys (only alphanum+'_' allowed)
TODO: plotcounts need some love for labels, errors and logscale hover.
TODO: hoverhandler: mouse leave figure should remove hoverf
FIXME: Mouse events do not work in secondary windows...
TODO: button to change y-axis (0->max, minnonzero->max). Automatically select the second when going to log-scale.
TODO: HistCollection needs browser/display mode
      - arrows for going back and forth
      - keys for bringing up a navigation menu
TODO: Disable hover-box+highlight when mouse over stat/info window or when in zoom mode.
TODO: info script needs: savefig
TODO: info script needs: better plotting (needs just 1 window and menu for navigation)
TODO: plotter: Somehow export python module for getting the standard plot environment?
TODO: plotter: xylabels should be either centered or at end of axis? (or simply implement snapping?)
TODO: plotter: dblclick on title/labels to edit
TODO: plotter: persistify state? (could serialise histogram + changed settings)
TODO: make sure we get rid of all todo's/fixme's from the code.
TODO: dump methods should put common stuff in HistBase
TODO: browse script should show hist type
TODO: HistCol: getNHists?, .histograms property so one can loop over hists in python (and C++ with iterators)?
TODO: Hist2D should also have ZLabel property (if we support lego).
TODO: A "comment" field on histbase (like title/labels, but not displayed in plots)
TODO: 2d needs mode to display lego plots and projections (problem: stuff can be overflowing in the other direction)
TODO: Needs scale(x>0) function, and a specialised normalise function() (can exist on both 1d and 2d hists).
//Scale(a): m_contents[i]*=a,m_errors[i]*=a*a,overflow*=a (triggers initErrors() first!)
assert(a>0). normalise should have option to include overflow bins in calculation of scale-factor.
#TODO: Copy constructor (or clone method?)
#TODO: 1d y-log-scale mode needs to change ylim (to keep the axes)
TODO: replace all(ish) asserts with throw's
