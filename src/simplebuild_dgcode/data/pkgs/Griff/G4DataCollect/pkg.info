package(USEPKG G4Interfaces GriffFormat)

######################################################################


Package providing functionality for writing out Geant4 simulation steps. It is
activated by simple calls in your main Geant4 program. For instance like this
from python (the C++ interface can be used instead of course:

    #Ask to collect step data in custom output file (other options instead
    #of "FULL" are "REDUCED" or "MINIMAL"):
    G4DataCollect.installHooks("test_output.griff","FULL")

    #after simulation is done, close output file, de-install hooks:
    G4DataCollect.finish()

The written datafile can be read with utilities from the GriffDataRead package
which does not itself depend on Geant4.

TODO:

* G4DataCollect.ignoreCurrentEvent() / G4DataCollect::ignoreCurrentEvent()
  interface, allowing for custom filters at generation level.
* Properly document the file format.

== Details of file format ==

The users should never have to know this, but for reference the file format is
described here:

First one magic 32bit word specifying the file type. We choose 0xE5506EA4 (with
a heavy dose of imagination it could kind of vaguely resemble ESS_GEA4).

Next follows one 32bit word with the file format version (allowing for potential
evolution of the format).

After this follows a number of event blocks. One block for each event in the
file, each block having variable length.

Each event block starts with a few words identifying the event and giving the
length of internal subsections:

  32bit word: event number
  32bit word: run number
  32bit word: length database section [bytes]
  32bit word: length trackdata section [bytes]
  32bit word: length stepdata section [bytes]

After this block follows the three sections: database, trackdata and stepdata.

The database section must always be read, but the other two can be ignored if
the reader is skipping forward through the file. This is because event number N
in a file might point to information from all first 1..N database sections (to
avoid redundancy).

The trackdata section will contain information about tracks: trackID's,
mother/daughter relationships and energy+energy deposits along each track
segment. A track segment is defined as the series of consecutive steps which
are contained in the same volume.

Finally the stepdata section will contain the detailed step info for each
segment.

The reason for the segment concept and the split in trackdata/stepdata sections
is of course computing efficiency: Most analysis will be easily done at the
segment level, with only a small part (if any) of the stepdata needing to be
retrieved. For certain applications one can even imagine not needing the
stepdata at all, allowing much higher statistics simulations for a given amount
of data storage.

== The database section ==

Detailed information about particles, volumes and processes are listed in these
sections and referred to in the trackdata/stepdata sections merely by cheap
integer indices. For instance in the first event where a particle of a given
pdgcode is encountered entries will be added in the database section of that
event with name, mass, charge, etc. for that pdgcode. Each entry will have the form:

 4bits: info type [ 0=particle info, 1=volume info, 2=process info, 3=evt description, ...]
 28bits: info length [=n]
 64bits: info index
 n bytes: data
